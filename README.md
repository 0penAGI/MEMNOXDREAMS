# README: Undertale - Architect's Dreams

## 📖 Project Description

**Undertale: Architect's Dreams** is an interactive web page inspired by the aesthetics of the Undertale game, allowing users to explore architectural concepts through the lens of dreams and quantum physics. The project combines elements of gamification, psychedelic visualization, and generative content.

## 🎮 Core Features

- **Dream Input**: Users can describe their dreams in a text field
- **Quantum Visualization**: Animated indicators demonstrating quantum entanglement
- **Architectural Concept Generation**: System analyzes input and generates corresponding architectural imagery
- **Interactive Actions**: Four interaction options (Fight, Act, Item, Mercy) in Undertale style
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile devices

## 🛠 Technical Features

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects
- **Generative Content**: Algorithmic generation of architectural concepts
- **Performance Optimization**: Consideration of mobile device limitations

## 🎨 Visual Elements

- **Heart-Eye**: Animated logo with pulsing heart
- **Noise Texture**: Animated background with aging/static effect
- **Bone Floor**: Animated floor in Undertale style
- **Starry Sky**: Twinkling stars in the background
- **Glitch Effects**: Text animations in technical malfunction style

## 📱 Compatibility

- **Desktop Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Devices**: Full touch input support
- **Telegram Web Apps**: Basic integration (commented in code)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Describe your dream in the text field
3. Interact with the interface using buttons:
   - **Fight**: Symbolic confrontation with the void
   - **Act**: Generate architectural concept based on dream
   - **Item**: Activate quantum visualization
   - **Mercy**: Create implementation plan for architectural concept
